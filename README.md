# Deep-learning-coursera
Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 
Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)
## Introduction
This repo contains all my works for this specialization. All the codes and projects are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
## What I want to say

**VERBOSE CONTENT WARNING: YOU CAN JUMP TO THE NEXT SECTION IF YOU WANT**

As a non-CS major student but full of enthusiasm to the Artificial Intellegence relevant fields. It must be a very tough period for the transformation, but no pain no gain for the dream! As a long-time self-taught learner, I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, and opencourses in YouTube. I had done many notes on my own Evernote for my study until one day I find some inspired repos for the problems that confused my for many days, so I decided to revise and put some of my codes and notes into my github repo step by step. I do understand the hard time you spend on understanding new concepts and debugging your program especially for the freshman and layman, like me a ME student but dream into the AI fields.
Here I released the deep learning specialization's solutions, which are the latest courses IÂ have taken. **But all these solutions only for your reference purpose. No copy, no cheat**. And I hope these can help you to save some time and answer your confusion but hope you don't copy any part of the code before you start your own attempts. 
Currently, this repo has 3 major parts you may be interested in and I will give a list here.

## Important Slide Notes

I screenshotted some important slide page and store them into GitHub issues. It seems not very helpful for everyone since I only keep those I think may be useful to me.
